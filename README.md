## Description

Memories On A Map is an application that allows users relive the memories of all the places they have seen in the world. With this app, users can drop a pin anywhere on the world map and upload photos of their trip. Once uploaded, you can sit back and reminisce by watching the photos scroll by on the in-screen photo carousel.

## More about us
We are a group of students persuing our certificate for Full-Stack Web Development. This is our first React group project. The idea was hatched by Kirk, a life-long musician, who wanted to make a map of all the venues he has played. We loved it! Rafael and I thought it would be something the world would enjoy. It's a work in progress! We have many more ideas and will be implementing some really great additions in the future. We hope you enjoy using our app!

Official documentation warn about dealing with FileList objects as considered "at risk", and changes in near future are very likely. This is just one of our study bootcamp end of module group projects, and for practice purposes only.
